#  title: "Solving (team) dependencies - the Open Source way"
#  abstract:
#    - "Teams should be able to work independently. In an ideal world, a team has control over all components needed to ship value to their customers. Often though that is far from true. In more than the past two decades Open Source projects have shown how much value can be generated by pooling resources and collaborating globally across organisations to solve challenges together."
