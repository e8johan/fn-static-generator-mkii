<p>Get your ticket via the <a href="https://foss-north.se/events/2023/register/">ticket registration</a> page (requires the setup of an account).</p>

<p><i>The ticket registration process requires you to register using an OpenID source. At the moment we support github and Google. If you cannot identify using these services we offer a manual process. This means getting the ticket via mail and processing the payment via bank transfer. Please notice that this process involves a substantial amount of additional work for the organizers so we urge you to consider using the standard process which is quicker and easier. To request a ticket manually, please email us at info@foss-north.se with the subject line "Ticket foss-north 2023".</i></p>

<p>Tickets bought before <strong>April 10th</strong> include lunch and coffee. Tickets are still sold until the day before the event, but does not include catering. We have ordered more food than weâ€™ve sold tickets on April 10th, so we hope to be able to provide food to all participants, but we cannot guarantee this due to lead times ordering supplies.</p>

<p>Tickets are sold in the following categories:</p>

<div class="row">
