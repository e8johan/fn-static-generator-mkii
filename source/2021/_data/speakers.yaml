  abstract:
    - "Teams should be able to work independently. In an ideal world, a team has control over all components needed to ship value to their customers. Often though that is far from true. In more than the past two decades Open Source projects have shown how much value can be generated by pooling resources and collaborating globally across organisations to solve challenges together."
    - "In this talk we will see how using Open Source collaboration best practices in your organisation can help deal with team interdependencies. We will see how solving common challenges together can increase speed and innovation. Finally we will explore how what we've learnt translates to your relationship of Open Source projects as a user."

Unfortunately, for a long time, there was only one Rust D-Bus crate and most users were not happy about it for various reasons, most notably that it depends on a notoriously bad C library, libdbus. zbus, was created out of this demand for a pure Rust API that makes D-Bus easy and simple. With both elegance and efficiency as the top goals, the development of of zbus has been a much greater challenge than original anticipated but slowly they were all overcome."

The author of the talk, strongly affected by said penchant for JavaScript and a long-time Linux user decided to give it a try."
    - "This talk represents a developer's view on creating non-trivial applications for Gnome. It looks into highly visible things, like creating widgets and parts of the user interface and compares it to working with modern JavaScript web frameworks like Angular and React. Then we take a step further and add non-trivial \"business logic\", interacting with data locally, working with the rest of Gnome and the OS."
    - "Finally, in the spirit of a true JavaScript, the application goes to internet and greets the world via public APIs such as Mastodon's."

  abstract:
    - "As the adoption of open source software grows, organizations that have traditionally relied upon proprietary software are taking their first steps to architect open source business strategies. For open source software vendors, acting as partner and community co-creator with these organizations is a critical aspect of opening new market opportunities, advancing innovation, and increasing overall value for their customers. But what does community engagement actually mean when considered through the lens of an industry vertical rather than a particular software project?"
    - "In this talk, Leslie Hawthorn will explore how community engagement in software foundations, industry consortia, and open source projects can underpin an organization's entry into new market verticals and deepen relationships with existing customers through collaboration. She will also explore recent trends in open source and open standards as each emerges as a market force in industry verticals such as Automotive, Financial Services, Industry 4.0, and Telecommunications. Attendees will leave with a blueprint for their first steps in architecting a vertical community strategy that provides authentic value to their business and their customers."

  title: "Porting the Oberon system to the RISC-V instruction set architecture"
  abstract:
    - "The Oberon system is a free operating system designed to be small, fast, and simple enough that a single person can understand it in its entirety. In doing so, it presents an interesting, if retro, alternative to modern operating systems that only grow more and more complex. It was first designed in the late 1980s by, among others, Niklaus Wirth, who is best-known for having designed Pascal, who then later revived it in 2013. In this most recent iteration, it even runs on its own simplistic, open instruction set architecture, such that one person can truly understand everything from the hardware to the firmware and software."
    - "In recent years, RISC-V has become increasingly popular as an open instruction set architecture. Its modular nature allows for using only the subset of instructions needed for your system, meaning a RISC-V implementation can be very simple. With this potential for openness and simplicity, it seems like a natural fit for the Oberon system. In this talk, I will give a quick history of the Oberon system, an idea of what makes it different from modern operating systems, and what we can still learn from it today. I will also go through some of the issues that arose in porting it to RISC-V, to evaluate how RISC-V compares to an ISA custom-designed for a single purpose."
