  title: "The Business of Community: Strategic Open Source Engagement for Vertical Markets"
  abstract:
    - "As the adoption of open source software grows, organizations that have traditionally relied upon proprietary software are taking their first steps to architect open source business strategies. For open source software vendors, acting as partner and community co-creator with these organizations is a critical aspect of opening new market opportunities, advancing innovation, and increasing overall value for their customers. But what does community engagement actually mean when considered through the lens of an industry vertical rather than a particular software project?"
    - "In this talk, Leslie Hawthorn will explore how community engagement in software foundations, industry consortia, and open source projects can underpin an organization's entry into new market verticals and deepen relationships with existing customers through collaboration. She will also explore recent trends in open source and open standards as each emerges as a market force in industry verticals such as Automotive, Financial Services, Industry 4.0, and Telecommunications. Attendees will leave with a blueprint for their first steps in architecting a vertical community strategy that provides authentic value to their business and their customers."
  bio:
    - "An internationally known open source strategist and community engagement expert, Leslie Hawthorn has spent the past 15 years creating, cultivating, and enabling open source communities. Her career has provided her with the opportunity to develop, hone, and share open source business expertise spanning enterprise to NGOs, including senior roles at Red Hat, Google, the Open Source Initiative, and Elastic. She currently leads the team responsible for vertical community engagement within Red Hat's Open Source Program Office in the Office of the CTO."
    - "Born and raised in Silicon Valley, Leslie has called Europe home for the past six years and resides in Bonn, Germany with her daughter and their two canaries, Elle and Nana. She enjoys dreaming about how open source and open standards can create citizen-centric Smart Cities and making banana cake with her little one."

  title: "Solving (team) dependencies - the Open Source way"
  abstract:
    - "Teams should be able to work independently. In an ideal world, a team has control over all components needed to ship value to their customers. Often though that is far from true. In more than the past two decades Open Source projects have shown how much value can be generated by pooling resources and collaborating globally across organisations to solve challenges together."
    - "In this talk we will see how using Open Source collaboration best practices in your organisation can help deal with team interdependencies. We will see how solving common challenges together can increase speed and innovation. Finally we will explore how what we've learnt translates to your relationship of Open Source projects as a user."
  bio:
    - "Isabel Drost-Fromm is a member of the Apache Software Foundation, a co-founder and board member of the InnerSource Commons Foundation, and a member of the inaugural Open Source and Intellectual Property Advisory Group of the United Nations Technology Innovation Labs (UNTIL). She's interested in all things search and text mining, and has experience in open source project governance and open collaboration. She's currently working at Europace AG as Open Source Strategist."

  title: "Into the Jungle - How to write a Linux kernel driver for any subsystem"
  abstract: 
    - "Entering a code base you do not know might be intimidating. However, there are techniques allowing to understand, and integrate with (nearly) any piece of code."
    - "In this talk we're going to show those techniques with an example of writing a network Linux driver from scratch. We will look into the documentation, source code of similar drivers, show what the driver should be doing to be functional.. and more. The audience will be encouraged to use the same methodology for any other unfamiliar code base."
    - "Basic knowledge of git and Linux systems is recommended to fully benefit from the talk."
  bio:
    - "Marta Rybczynska has network security background and 15 years of experience in embedded development. She has been working with embedded operating systems like Linux and various real-time ones, system libraries and frameworks up to user interfaces.
